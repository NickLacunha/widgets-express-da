Demo-style application written exclusively as a portfolio piece.

To eventually include:
1. A database with models for a (hypothetical) equipment-rental business
2. An API providing access to the database
3. A desktop application for (hypothetical) dispatchers to interact with the database (to be written with electron-edge)
4. A mobile application allowing drivers to check their route, notify dispatch when deliveries or pickups are complete, and receive on-the-fly updates when changes to the route occur. (to be written natively for Android)

Work on the database component (1) and API (2) began 3-16-2017. I'm using Entity Framework code-first and ASP .NET WebAPI as the base stack for this, so these components will be developed in parallel.
